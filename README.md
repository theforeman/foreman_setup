# foreman_setup

Setting up Foreman for provisioning can be daunting at first, as there are
lots of parameters to configure DHCP and DNS for the installer, plus for setup
of subnets, domains, installation media etc for Foreman.

# Installation

Please see the Foreman wiki for appropriate instructions:

* [Foreman: How to Install a Plugin](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/How_to_Install_a_Plugin)

The gem name is "foreman_setup".  Run `foreman-rake db:migrate` after
installation.

RPM users can install the "tfm-rubygem-foreman_setup" or
"rubygem-foreman_setup" packages.
